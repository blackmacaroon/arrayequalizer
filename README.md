# arrayequalizer

Dude has an array of integers. He wants to reduce the array until all remaining elements are equal. Determine the minimum number of elements he needs to delete to reach his goal.

For example, if his array is [1, 2, 2, 3], we see that he can delete the two elements 1 and 3 leaving [2, 2]. He could also delete both 2s and either the 1 or 3 , but that would take 3 deletions. The minimum number of deletions is 2.
